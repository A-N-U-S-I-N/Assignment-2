    <h1>Web Development</h1><hr>
    <p>Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications. In the early days of web development, around the 1990s, websites were simple and mostly consisted of static HTML pages. As technology advanced, web development became more complex and dynamic.</p>
    <p>During the early 2000s, web development saw the rise of server-side scripting languages like PHP and ASP.NET, which allowed for more interactive and dynamic websites. This led to the development of content management systems (CMS) like WordPress and Drupal, making it easier for non-technical users to create and manage their websites.</p>
    <p>As the decade progressed, the concept of Web 2.0 emerged, focusing on user-generated content and interactivity. This gave birth to social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, which required more advanced web development techniques.</p>
    <p>The introduction of JavaScript frameworks like jQuery, AngularJS, and React in the late 2000s revolutionized web development by enabling the creation of highly interactive and responsive web applications.</p>
    <p>Overall, web development in the 2000s witnessed a shift from static websites to dynamic, interactive, and user-centric experiences. The advancements in technology, scripting languages, and frameworks paved the way for the modern web we enjoy today. It's an exciting field that continues to evolve and shape the digital landscape. üòäüåê</p>
