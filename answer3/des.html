    <h1>Web Design</h1><hr>
    <p></p>Web design is the process of creating the visual and aesthetic aspects of a website. In the early days of the internet, web design was focused on creating simple layouts and basic graphics. However, as technology advanced and user expectations grew, web design became more sophisticated and dynamic.
    <p>During the early 2000s, web design saw the emergence of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which allowed designers to separate the presentation of a website from its structure. This enabled greater flexibility and control over the visual aspects of a website.</p>
    <p>As the decade progressed, web design became more focused on user experience (UX) and usability. Designers started to prioritize intuitive navigation, clear information hierarchy, and visually appealing interfaces. This led to the development of design principles such as responsive design, which ensures that websites adapt and look great on different devices.</p>
    <p>The late 2000s saw the rise of minimalist and flat design, characterized by clean lines, ample white space, and bold typography. This design approach aimed to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.</p>
    <p>Today, web design continues to evolve with the introduction of new technologies and design trends. Designers now incorporate animations, microinteractions, and immersive experiences to engage users and create memorable web experiences.</p>
    <p>In summary, web design in the 2000s witnessed a shift from basic layouts to visually appealing and user-centric designs. It's an exciting field that combines creativity, usability, and the latest design trends to create stunning websites. ðŸ˜ŠðŸŽ¨</p>
